# Vox Development TS3 Bot

**We do NOT provide support as this product has reached its end of life, which means there will be minimal updates and bug fixes.**

The steps to set it up are the following;

*Make sure you have a TS3 Server with Query enabled*

1. Install the latest [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
2. Fill out the `config.js` file and do not skip any fields unless you want your bot broken.
3. Open CMD *(if using pterodactyl you can skip these steps, just upload your files to your server and run it)*
4. CD into the directory the bot is in and run `npm i`
5. Start the bot using `node .`
